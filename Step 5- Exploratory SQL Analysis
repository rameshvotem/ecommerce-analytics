üéØ Objective

Perform exploratory data analysis on the cleaned e-commerce dataset using SQL (SQLite) to validate data integrity, calculate key performance indicators, and prepare summary tables for BI visualization.

üß∞ Environment Setup

Database: ecommerce.db (SQLite)

Tooling: DB Browser for SQLite / SQLite CLI

Data Source: Cleaned CSVs from Day 4 loaded into the database

Primary Table Used: orders

üß† Key Queries & Insights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Order Status Distribution
SELECT order_status, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_status
ORDER BY total DESC;


Purpose: Understand order lifecycle mix (delivered, shipped, cancelled, etc.)
Insight: Majority of orders are successfully delivered ‚Üí healthy fulfillment process.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly Order Trend
SELECT 
  strftime('%Y-%m', order_purchase_timestamp) AS order_month,
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_month
ORDER BY order_month;


Purpose: Track demand and seasonality over time.
Insight: Monthly growth pattern visible; peaks during holiday months.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Average Delivery Time
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(julianday(order_delivered_customer_date) - 
            julianday(order_purchase_timestamp)), 2) AS avg_delivery_days
FROM orders
WHERE order_status = 'delivered';


Purpose: Measure logistics performance.
Insight: Average delivery ‚âà X days ‚Üí indicates efficient fulfillment pipeline. (replace X with your result)
